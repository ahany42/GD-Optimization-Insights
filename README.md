# Gradient Descent Implementation 

This project implements **Gradient Descent from scratch** to analyze how different hyperparametersâ€”**number of epochs** and **learning rate**â€”affect the **Mean Square Error (MSE)**.

## ðŸš€ Overview
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models. This project:
- Implements Gradient Descent without external ML libraries.
- Compares different learning rates and epoch values.
- Evaluates the impact on Mean Square Error (MSE).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Custom implementation of Gradient Descent.
- Adjustable hyperparameters: **epochs** and **learning rate**.
- Visual analysis of MSE convergence.
